Individual software engineers may use this folder to store small scripts that
perform machine-specific environment setup (to prepare their own local machines
for building this project).

While these scripts are expected to _NOT_ "just work" on any other engineer's
machine, there is some benefit to keeping them checked in with git.

Benefits include:

- Other teammates might "take inspiration" or adapt these scripts for their own
  local use.
- By committing these in git, we can all still use 'git clean' commands without
  risking that we will accidentally delete one of our favorite local helper
  scripts.
